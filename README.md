# Sudontku
An automatic sudoku solver along with a simple GUI

So this project was one I made quite a while back. I just got really frustrated solving sudokus myself and made a program to do it for me.

I also used this to practice tkinter for my exams and upcoming projects. It was nice to play around with tkinter.

However the program feels clunky and hard to read. I would definitely make it more visually appealing if I were to make this project today but oh well.

This is also a good example of the backtracking concept which came in handy for other subjects as well. 
Basically this project was extremely useful for me :)
